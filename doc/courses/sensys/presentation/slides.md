## Agenda Today

  1. Intro to hardware, tools and development environment

  2. Write an end-to-end Bluetooth Low Energy environment sensing application

  3. Add functionality to the Tock kernel

    - Write some Rust!

# Part 1: Hardware, tools, and development environment

## Hail

![](hail.png)

## We need the Hails back at the end of the tutorial

But you can take one home with you! Purchase here:

<https://tockos.org/hardware>

Put in "SENSYS17" for $5 off, and "2600 Hearst Ave, Berkeley CA 94709" as the address for local pickup.

## Binaries on-board in flash

  - `0x00000`: **Bootloader**: Interact with Tockloader; load code

  - `0x10000`: **Kernel**

  - `0x30000`: **Processes**: Packed back-to-back

## Tools

  * `make`

  * Rust/Cargo (Rust code → LLVM)

  * `arm-none-eabi` (LLVM → Cortex-M)

  * `tockloader` to interact with Hail and the bootloader

## Tools: `tockloader`

Write a binary to a particular address in flash

```bash
$ tockloader flash --address 0x10000 \
    target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/hail.bin
```

Program a process in Tock Binary Format[^footnote]:

```bash
$ tockloader install myapp.tab
```

Restart the board and connect to the debug console:

```bash
$ tockloader listen
```

[^footnote]: TBFs are relocatable process binaries prefixed with headers like
  the package name. `.tab` is a tarball of TBFs for different architectures as
  well as a metadata file for `tockloader`.

## Check your understanding

Turn to the person next to you:

  1. What kinds of binaries exist on a Tock board? Hint: There are three, and
     only two can be programmed using `tockloader`.

<!--   2. Can you point to the chip on the Hail that runs the Tock kernel? How about
     the processes? -->

  2. What steps would you follow to program a process onto Hail? What about
     to replace the kernel?

## Answers

  1. The three binaries are the serial bootloader, the kernel, and a series of
     processes. The bootloader can be used to load the kernel and processes, but
     cannot replace itself.

  2. Use `tockloader`:

     * `tockloader install app.tab`

     * `tockloader flash --address 0x10000 hail-kernel.bin`

## Hands-on: Set-up development environment

  3. Compile and program the kernel

  4. (Optional) Familiarize yourself with `tockloader` commands

    * `uninstall`

    * `list`

    * `erase-apps`

  5. (Optional) Add some other apps from the repo, like `blink` and `sensors`

# Part 2: User space

## System calls

Tock supports five syscalls that applications use to interact with the kernel.

| **Call**  | **Target** | **Description**                  |
|:----------|:----------:|----------------------------------|
| command   | Capsule    | Invoke an operation on a capsule |
| allow     | Capsule    | Share memory with a capsule      |
| subscribe | Capsule    | Register an upcall               |
| memop     | Core       | Modify memory break              |
| yield     | Core       | Block until next upcall is ready |

## C System Calls: `command` & `allow`

```c
// Start an operation
int command(u32 driver, u32 command, int arg1, int arg2);

// Share memory with the kernel
int allow(u32 driver, u32 allow, void* ptr, size_t size);
```

## C System Calls: `subscribe`

```c
// Callback function type
typedef void (sub_cb)(int, int, int, void* userdata);

// Register a callback with the kernel
int subscribe(u32 driver,
              u32 subscribe,
              sub_cb cb,
              void* userdata);
```

## C System Calls: `yield` & `yield_for`

```c
// Block until next callback
void yield(void);

// Block until a specific callback
void yield_for(bool *cond) {
  while (!*cond) {
    yield();
  }
}
```

<!-- ## Example: printing to the debug console

```c
static void putstr_cb(int _x, int _y, int _z, void* ud) {
  putstr_data_t* data = (putstr_data_t*)ud;
  data->done = true;
}

int putnstr(const char *str, size_t len) {
  putstr_data_t data;
  data.buf = str;
  data.done = false;

  allow(DRIVER_NUM_CONSOLE, 1, str, len);
  subscribe(DRIVER_NUM_CONSOLE, 1, putstr_cb, &data);
  command(DRIVER_NUM_CONSOLE, 1, len, 0);
  yield_for(&data.done);
  return ret;
}
``` -->

## Example: printing to the debug console

```c
#define DRIVER_NUM_CONSOLE 0x0001

bool done = false;

static void putstr_cb(int x, int y, int z, void* ud) {
  done = true;
}

int putnstr(const char *str, size_t len) {
  allow(DRIVER_NUM_CONSOLE, 1, str, len);
  subscribe(DRIVER_NUM_CONSOLE, 1, putstr_cb, NULL);
  command(DRIVER_NUM_CONSOLE, 1, len, 0);
  yield_for(&done);

  return SUCCESS;
}
```

## Inter Process Communication (IPC)

![](ipc.pdf)

## Tock Inter Process Communication Overview

*Servers*

 * Register as an IPC service
 * Call `notify` to trigger callback in connected client
 * Receive a callback when a client calls `notify`

*Clients*

 * Discover IPC services by application name
 * Able to share a buffer with a connected service
 * Call `notify` to trigger callback in connected service
 * Receive a callback when service calls `notify`

## Client Inter Process Communication API

```c
// Discover IPC service by name
int ipc_discover(const char* pkg_name);

// Share memory slice with IPC service
int ipc_share(int pid, void* base, int len);

// Register for callback on server `notify`
int ipc_register_client_cb(int pid, subscribe_cb cb,
                           void* userdata);

// Trigger callback in service
int ipc_notify_svc(int pid);
```

## Check your understanding

Turn to the person next to you:

1. How does a process perform a blocking operation? Can you draw the flow of
   operations when a process calls `delay_ms(1000)`?

2. Which functions would a client call to interact with an IPC service that
   provides a UART console? What does the design of the console service look like?

## Answers

\footnotesize

  1. A blocking call follows these steps:

     * Set up a callback using `subscribe`

     * Initiate an operation with `command`

     * Continually `yield` using `yield_for`

  2. A console service first registers a callback to receive notifications from
     clients. When the callback triggers, it uses a buffer shared by the client
     and prints the contents to the console.

     * Call `ipc_discover()` to find the ID of the console service.

     * Call `ipc_share` to share a buffer where output will live

     * Fill the buffer with output

     * Call `ipc_notify_svc` to invoke a console write.

# Part 3: The kernel

## Trusted Computing Base (`unsafe` allowed)

  * Hardware Abstraction Layer

  * Board configuration

  * Event & Process scheduler

  * Rust `core` library

  * Core Tock primitives

```
arch/
chips/
kernel/
```

## Capsules (`unsafe` not allowed)

  * Virtualization

  * Peripheral drivers

  * Communication protocols (IP, USB, etc)

  * Application logic

```
capsules/
```

## Constraints

### Small isolation units

Breaking a monolithic component into smaller ones should have low/no cost

### Avoid memory exhaustion in the kernel

No heap. Everything is allocated statically.

### Low communication overhead

Communicating between components as cheap as an internal function call. Ideally
inlined.

## Event-driven execution model

```rust
pub fn main<P, C>(platform: &P, chip: &mut C,
                  processes: &mut [Process]) {
    loop {
        chip.service_pending_interrupts();
        for (i, p) in processes.iter_mut().enumerate() {
            sched::do_process(platform, chip, process);
        }

        if !chip.has_pending_interrupts() {
            chip.prepare_for_sleep();
            support::wfi();
        }
    }
}
```

## Event-driven execution model

```rust
fn service_pending_interrupts(&mut self) {
    while let Some(interrupt) = get_interrupt() {
        match interrupt {
            ASTALARM => ast::AST.handle_interrupt(),
            USART0 => usart::USART0.handle_interrupt(),
            USART1 => usart::USART1.handle_interrupt(),
            USART2 => usart::USART2.handle_interrupt(),
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Event-driven execution model

```rust
impl Ast {
    pub fn handle_interrupt(&self) {
        self.clear_alarm();
        self.callback.get().map(|cb| { cb.fired(); });
    }
}
impl time::Client for MuxAlarm {
    fn fired(&self) {
        for cur in self.virtual_alarms.iter() {
            if cur.should_fire() {
                cur.armed.set(false);
                self.enabled.set(self.enabled.get() - 1);
                cur.fired();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Check your understanding

Turn to the person next to you:

  1. What are Tock kernel components called?

  2. Is the kernel scheduled cooperatively or preemptively? What happens if a
     capsule performs a very long computation?

  3. How is a hardware interrupt handled in the kernel?

## Answers

  1. Tock kernel components are called "capsules"

  2. The kernel is scheduled cooperatively by capsules calling methods on each
     other. If a capsule performs a very long computation it might prevent
     other capsules from running or cause them to miss events.

  3. Hardware interrupts are scheduled to run when capsules next yield. If a
     process is running when a hardware event happens, the hardware event will
     be immediately handled.

## Hands-on: Write and add a capsule to the kernel

  4. Read the Hail boot sequence in `boards/hail/src/main.rs`

  5. Write a new capsule that prints "Hello World" to the debug
     console.

  6. Extend your capsule to print "Hello World" every second

  7. Extend your capsule to print light readings every second
